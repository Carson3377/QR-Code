## My process

### Built with

### What I learned
I've learnt to build a digital QR-Code along with basic frontend language and using BootStrap framework as catalyst of the coding process. It's very easy though, this is just an amateur level and I should recommend this to beginner who's looking for substanstial practices or become a frontend developer.
